        <p>
          Born in Pergamino, Argentina, her contact with cooking began very
          early in the family kitchen, encouraged by the aromas of her
          grandmother's recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about her profession, from a very young age she began to
          forge her extensive career in which she would stand out not only as a
          cook, and a kitchen teacher but also as the owner of her company and
          advisor in the development of important ventures gastronomic.

            Amid the nation’s worst Covid-19 outbreak, patients are trapped in

            who is most likely to survive.

            fate in the midterms and the success of the Biden presidency.
